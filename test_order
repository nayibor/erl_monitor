docuementation/test cases  
have to write type specs for all the record types in the system otherwise one day i wont be able to understand it myself one day:)
have to change the site table so it stores the rules in it .so only one lookup operation needs to be perfomed to process transactions 



later but important

rule category  --basic table --done but no interface
template category --basic table -- done but no interface
create a behaviour for a financial message and its processing/spec should be external to the system and modifiable

erlang
yaws
mnesia
erlydtl
jquery
ranch ??
messagepack
mithral.js

jpos
xref is a very useful addition when writing code
django templates use of lists everywhere can make it difficult to use 
storing complex data in mnesia data can be difficult
specs in erlang are very interesting
writing clear vrs fast code
storing of funs in db can be interesting
data formats???
you cant use numeric variables as keys in javascript objects
be very careful with how erlang treats characters .
js ??????
supervisors return the initial state the data was started with when restarting children
restart in this context


interesting use of jpos library
